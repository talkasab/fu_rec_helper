### Pitfalls to Avoid

- Use the tool **only** as the last step in working with the report
  - Trainees: Before prelim signing or releasing for attending review
  - Attendings: Before final sign 
- All fields must be filled in
- Time range (different start/end dates) are required (range as broad as possible, usually at least 1 month)
- Be aware of multiple recommendations
- All recommendations must be Accepted or Declined to send to Epic
- Do **NOT** press the "Flag for Review" button

Learn the basics of how to use the Follow-up Recommendations tool in PowerScribe to
create actionable recommendations and send them to Epic. 
                
Make sure to understand how to fill in all the required fields.

Consider practicing with the tool simulator to see what would be recommended with
different inputs.

recommendation must be accepted or declined.
