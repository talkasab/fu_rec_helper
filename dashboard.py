- Use MGB username/password to log in
- Shows prior recommendations, both those which are well-formed and those which will require an addendum. 
- Periodically updates automatically
- New recommendations will appear in the dashboard between 2 and 5 minutes of being made

_(Unfortunately, unactionable recommendations don't update automatically once the addendum has been made yetâ€”
this feature will be added in the future.)_
